| Application Load Balancer | 1 ALB | $16.43 | Base cost + hourly charge |
| RDS PostgreSQL | db.t3.medium with Multi-AZ (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 50GB storage) | $147.20 | On-demand pricing with redundancy |
| Route 53 | 1 Hosted Zone + 5M queries | $2.50 | $0.50/zone + $0.40/million queries |
| CloudFront | 100GB/month + 5M requests | $11.00 | For static asset delivery |
| Data Transfer | 100GB/month | $9.00 | $0.09/GB after first 100GB |
| Certificate Manager | SSL Certificate | $0.00 | Free for public certificates |
| **Total** | | **$261.01** | |

## Enterprise Setup

This setup is designed for high-traffic applications with stringent availability requirements.

| Resource | Specifications | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| EC2 Instances | Auto Scaling: 3-6 × t3.large (2 vCPU, 8GB RAM) | $336.96 | Based on 4 instances average |
| Application Load Balancer | 1 ALB | $16.43 | Base cost + hourly charge |
| RDS PostgreSQL | db.r5.large with Multi-AZ (2 vCPU, 16GB RAM, 100GB storage) | $380.96 | Memory-optimized instance |
| RDS Read Replica | db.r5.large (2 vCPU, 16GB RAM, 100GB storage) | $190.48 | For read scaling |
| Route 53 | 1 Hosted Zone + 20M queries | $8.50 | $0.50/zone + $0.40/million queries |
| CloudFront | 500GB/month + 20M requests | $48.00 | For static asset delivery |
| CloudWatch | Detailed monitoring | $10.00 | For performance monitoring |
| AWS Shield | Standard | $0.00 | Free DDoS protection |
| Data Transfer | 500GB/month | $45.00 | $0.09/GB after first 100GB |
| Certificate Manager | SSL Certificate | $0.00 | Free for public certificates |
| **Total** | | **$1,036.33** | |

## Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Use Reserved Instances**
   - Save 30-60% on EC2 and RDS by committing to 1 or 3 years
   - Example: 1-year RI for t3.small EC2 reduces cost from $18.72 to ~$12.00/month

2. **Implement Auto Scaling**
   - Scale down during periods of low traffic 
   - Set min/max instance counts based on actual usage patterns

3. **Use Spot Instances** (for non-critical workloads)
   - Save up to 90% compared to on-demand prices
   - Good for background processing jobs

4. **Optimize RDS**
   - Use gp3 instead of gp2 storage for better price/performance
   - Consider Aurora Serverless v2 for variable workloads

5. **Reduce Data Transfer Costs**
   - Compress data when possible
   - Use CloudFront to cache static content
   - Keep data transfer within the same AWS region

6. **Monitor and Resize Resources**
   - Use AWS Cost Explorer to identify over-provisioned resources
   - Regularly review and resize instances based on actual utilization

## Cost Breakdown by Application Feature

| Feature | AWS Services Used | Approx. % of Cost | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Core Application | EC2, ELB | 25-30% | Web server and application logic |
| Database Operations | RDS | 40-45% | Data storage and retrieval |
| WebSocket Communication | EC2, ELB | 15-20% | Real-time updates |
| Content Delivery | CloudFront | 5-10% | Static assets |
| Domain Management | Route 53 | 1-2% | DNS management |
| Monitoring/Security | CloudWatch, Shield | 3-5% | Application monitoring |

## Billing Alerts and Budget Management

1. **Set Up Billing Alerts**
   - Go to AWS Billing Dashboard
   - Create billing alarms at 50%, 80%, and 100% of your budget
   - Configure notifications to be sent to your email

2. **Create AWS Budget**
   - Set monthly budget limit
   - Configure actions when thresholds are reached
   - Review spending regularly

3. **Use AWS Cost Explorer**
   - Analyze cost patterns
   - Identify cost anomalies
   - Forecast future costs

## Conclusion

The cost of running your Quiz Application on AWS can vary significantly based on scale, architecture choices, and usage patterns. Start with a minimal setup and scale as needed, implementing cost optimization strategies along the way.

Remember that these are estimates, and actual costs may vary. Always monitor your AWS billing dashboard and set up alerts to avoid unexpected charges.
